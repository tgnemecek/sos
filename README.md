# SOS: Switch Off Stress

SOS is a gamified app with stress-relieving techniques created by Sharon Seivert's book of the same name and also relaxing music to be played along. Available for iOS and Android.

## About the App

I created the app as a solo real-life project to learn about Unity Engine and C# in partnership with The Coreporation and Sharon Seivert.
It was made back in 2017 but I'm uploading it now to github as a portfolio piece on Unity programming.

## About the Music

The Music used in the app was composed and produced by me and can be listened [here](https://soundcloud.com/audioheadcx/sets/sos-switch-off-stress).

## What I've Learned

* Basic and intermediate usage of Unity Engine;
* Audio Module inside the Engine (live mixing);
* Programming in C#.
